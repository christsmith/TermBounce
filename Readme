TermBounce
Christopher Smith

TermBounce is just a goofly thing I wrote after a rough exam in first year engineering. It prints several characters bouncing around the edges of the terminal screen.

compile with a make command and run the resulting TermBounce excecutable.

The number of bouncing characters and the screen size can be configured at the top of the TermBounce.cpp file.
